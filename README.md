#LevelX
##What's this?
This is a mod inspired by Sethbling's levelling system, which will run without the need of command blocks, and should retain the same functionality.
##How can I run this?
Click over to [releases](https://github.com/calvcoll/levelx/releases), and download, either the latest build, if you are running the current Minecraft Forge, or, if not, you can download the last release for that Minecraft version. Then this will need to be placed within your mods folder.
##How can I compile/contribute?
It should be easy to compile and run, just through the use of `./gradlew build`, since it runs using the default Forge compilation tools.
I am likely to accept the pull requests you send as long as they will not break the balancing of the system, as far as I can see.
Also, if you are an artist, I'd love for some artwork for the mod, as this should help greatly.
